# Dasha (Darja) Filippova

I was born in the USSR, a country that dissolved, becoming an immigrant without ever moving. Displacement, (mis)translation, borders, ghosts and dreams are recurring themes in my multi-disciplinary practice, which focuses on the corporeal body and is smuggled across multiple mediums, including scholarly practice, performance, film/video and creative writing. Resurrecting the utopian promises of the socialist past, my work excavates alternative organizations of life in the neoliberal present.

I have a BA from Smith College, an MA from Central European University, an MA from The Art Institute of Chicago and a Phd from Princeton University. I’ve performed as Natasha (24, aquarius, non-smoker) with the Antibody Collective; I am founding member of Spaika.Media, a platform dedicated to Russian performance, art and activism; I am member of Fabrika Kukhnya, a feminist research collective. My films have been screened in Chicago, Detroit and Budapest. I was editor-in-chief of Gallery Guide in Beijing, a bilingual magazine about contemporary Chinese art. My writing has appeared in Leap, Art Margins, Randian, Utah Foreign Language Review, Poetics Today, Another New Calligraphy, The Point Journal, and elsewhere. Most broadly, I write about the intersection of performance studies and the study of global post-socialisms.

Since 2016, I have worked under the mentorship of the MacArthur Fellow artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña and the world-renowned performance collective La Pocha Nostra.

I live in NYC.
