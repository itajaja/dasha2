  Has anyone dropped their baby? <br/>
  Or baby fallen? <br/>
  Has anyone actually <br/>
  lost weight while breastfeeding ? <br/>
  I still have 25 pounds from pregnancy to lose <br/>
  and still don’t know if I should renew my wardrobe, <br/>
  Today I saw my truck from a distance in a parking lot <br/>
  and thought I had scratched my vehicle. <br/>
  Nope, it was my hair, disgusting!!!! <br/>
  Just stuck to the side along for a ride. <br/>
  Wrapped around my son’s penis <br/>
  probably cutting off the circulation <br/>
  I swear almost every diaper change <br/>
  Is your scar area still swollen? <br/>
  I’ll be 6 months pp next week <br/>
  Will it ever go away?! <br/>
